Python is one of my favorite programming languages. It is easy to learn, has an extensive ecosystem of libraries, and is highly versatile. Python is a great language to start with, and it can be used for a wide variety of tasks, including:

- Web application development
- Web scraping
- Automation scripts
- Machine learning
- Data science
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)

### Python Basics

#### Variable Types

Python supports several common data types:

- **String** – sequences of characters
- **Integer** – whole numbers
- **Float** – decimal numbers
- **Boolean** – `True` or `False`
- **List** – ordered, mutable collection
- **Set** – unordered collection of unique elements
- **Dictionary** – key-value pairs
- And many more advanced types (not covered in this course)

#### Are Variables Objects?

In Python, variables are references to objects. A variable is **not** the object itself—it points to the object in memory. This allows variables to use multiple methods and functions available to the object.  

- You can check the type of a variable using `type()`.
- Python variables are dynamically typed and can be reassigned to objects of different types. (Unlike statically typed languages such as Go, where types are fixed.)

#### Useful Variable Functions & Methods

- **Casting / Conversion**
  - `str()` – convert to string
  - `int()` – convert to integer
  - `set()` – convert to set
- **String formatting**
  - `f"{variable}"` – formatted string
- **String methods**
  - `.isdigit()` – checks if string is numeric
  - `.split()` – splits string into a list
- **List methods**
  - `.append(element)` – adds an element
- **Set methods**
  - `.add(element)` – adds an element
  - `.remove(element)` – removes an element
